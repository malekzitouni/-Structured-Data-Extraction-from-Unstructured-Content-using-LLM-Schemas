## Developing

### Usage of uv

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as package and project manager.

#### Installation

To install `uv`, check the documentation on [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

#### Create an environment and sync it

You can use the `uv sync` to create a project virtual environment (if it does not already exist) and sync
the project's dependencies with the environment.

```bash
uv sync
```

#### Use a specific Python version (optional)

If you need to work with a specific version of Python, you can create a new virtual environment for that version
and run the sync command:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
uv sync
```

More detailed options are described on the [Using Python environments](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/) documentation.

#### Add a new dependency

Simply use the `uv add` command. The `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files will be updated.

```bash
uv add [OPTIONS] <PACKAGES|--requirements <REQUIREMENTS>>
```

### Code sytle guidelines

We use the following tools to enforce code style:

- isort, to sort imports
- Black, to format code
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io), as static type checker

A set of styling checks, as well as regression tests, are defined and managed through the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework. To ensure that those scripts run automatically before a commit is finalized, install `pre-commit` on your local repository:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

To run the checks on-demand, type:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Note: Checks like `Black` and `isort` will _fail_ if they modify files. This is because `pre-commit` doesn't like to see files modified by their hooks. In these cases, `git add` the modified files and `git commit` again.
